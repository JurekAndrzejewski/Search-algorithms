Implement a simple route finder for the game of snake. Simple implementation of Snake using
PyGame2 has been provided on GitHub3 The game has been modified to include an additional
type of tiles that reduces the score and the length of the snake by 1 and as such should be avoided.
These tiles should be considered when implementing the cost function. Each time the algorithm
should generate a full path to the "fruit" block, which will then be executed in sequence. The
search algorithm should automatically stop when no path to the "fruit" can be found.
